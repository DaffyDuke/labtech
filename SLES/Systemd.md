# Systemd / Overview & Very Quick Troubleshooting

## Overview

### How to see system logs

Before : `tail -F /var/log/messages`
Now : `journalctl -xe`

Before : `dmesg`
Now : `journalctl --list-boots`

If you need to activate persistence, look at /etc/systemd/journald.conf and check you have Storage=auto or persistent.
If auto, create logdir
```
    mkdir /var/log/journal
    systemctl restart systemd-journald.service
```

### Play with services

Check system status : 
```
    systemctl status postfix
```

Restart mailer
```
    systemctl restart postfix
```

Enable a service at boot time
```
    systemctl enable postfix
```

Discover services
```
    systemctl list-units-files | grep service
```

Masking a service (so you will not able to start or enable it)
```
    systemctl mask postfix
```

Backward compatibility : /usr/sbin/service is used as it was systemd, but service list will be stored in /run/systemd/generator
